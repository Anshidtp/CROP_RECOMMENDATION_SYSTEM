## Project Overview:

The Crop Recommendation System leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized crop recommendations to farmers, enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability. By analyzing key environmental factors such as soil pH, rainfall, and humidity, our system identifies the most suitable crops for planting, tailored to each farmer's specific land conditions.

## Benefits
- **Optimized Crop Selection**: Empowers farmers with data-backed suggestions, maximizing yield and minimizing resource waste.
- **Increased Sustainability**: Promotes environmentally friendly farming practices by matching crops to the land's natural conditions.
- **Accessibility**: Through a user-friendly web application, farmers can easily access our recommendations, regardless of their technical expertise.
- **Informed Decision-Making**: Helps farmers make educated decisions about their crops, leading to better financial outcomes and crop diversity.

## Technical Stack:
- Machine Learning Algorithms: 

                        1. RandomForest Classifier
                        2. Decision Tree Classifier 
                        3. Gaussian NB
                        4. Logistic Regression

    RandomForest emerges as the most accurate, providing reliable guidance for crop selection.

- Backend Framework: Flask for creating a responsive and accessible web application.
